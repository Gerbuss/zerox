Zero X Night Club Website


This is a website for a night club called Zero X. The night club is a techno-house music venue with DJs and special events targetin young adults 25yo-35yo. Techno is a form of electronic dance music (edm). The term itself derives from the word technology and was developed in Detroit, Michigan in the 1980s. The stylistic attributes of techno are its repetitive 4x4 rhythms mostly created on drum machines, the use of synthesizers / sequencers and tempos ranging from 120bpm up to 150bpm. The idea of the website is that visitors can see pictures and listen to the music that plays in the club. Also, there are members that can access to the Members Only page where they can book tables, buy tickets and access to special private events.

The website is for the owners of the night club to attract clients to this venue and create interest and increase participation in their membership program. The membership program is free, providing exclusive features, such as tickets for member only events, drink specials, VIP sections, etc.

•	As a patron I want to be able to see forthcoming events.
•	As a patron I would like to have access to special events.
•	As a club owner I would like to increase the number of loyal and repeat patrons.
•	As a patron I would like to have access to new and special audio tracks.
•	As a patron I would like to have access to the best tables in the venue.

Features:

o	About page is a page where you can read information about the club and Djs performing in the club.
o	Events page shows pictures about different events at the club that can be seen for non-members as well as members only photographs can see and get informed about upcoming events.
o	The Top 5 page is for everybody, member and non-members can listen to the Top 5 songs. Note that there are audio tracks that only members can listen to.
o	The Gallery page provides pictures of different events that happened in the club. Again, members can see more pictures as non-members.
o	The Contact page is to get patrons and owners to get in touch. Also provides information about the business hours phone number and location of the club.
